# 📅 Project Journal - Day 2

**Date:** May 21, 2025  
**Day:** Thursday  

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- ✅ Researched and finalized a **professional folder structure** tailored for a **Flutter diet app** using **Firebase** and **BLoC**.
- ✅ Structured the project using **Clean Architecture** principles:
  - Clearly separated layers: `data`, `domain`, and `presentation`.
  - Included support for Firebase and BLoC-specific components (e.g., `datasources/remote`, `blocs/`, `usecases/`).
- ✅ Executed a **Bash command** to scaffold the entire folder hierarchy in one step.
- ✅ Wrote a detailed **Markdown documentation** explaining the folder structure, ideal for GitHub README or project documentation.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Concepts Used

- **Firebase** (Firestore, Auth – future integration)
- **BLoC** (for modular and reactive state management)
- **Clean Architecture** (for scalable and testable app design)
- **Bash** (for command-line automation of folders)
- **Markdown** (for documentation)

---

## ✍️ Notes

- The folder structure is now ready for scalable feature development.
- Domain-driven separation ensures a clean separation of concerns and ease of testing.
- Tomorrow’s plan is to start integrating Firebase (Auth) and implementing the UI for the **Login** and **Get Started** screens using the designed layout.
